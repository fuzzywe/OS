A system call is a mechanism that allows a program (typically an application) to request a service from the operating system's kernel. System calls act as a controlled interface between user-space programs and the lower-level, privileged operations of the kernel.

Key Points about System Calls:
Purpose: System calls enable programs to:

Interact with hardware.
Access or modify system resources.
Perform operations like file manipulation, process control, or network communication.
Execution Mode:

User Mode: Applications typically run in user mode, where direct access to hardware or critical system resources is restricted.
Kernel Mode: The operating system runs in this privileged mode, managing hardware and system resources.
A system call transitions the program from user mode to kernel mode.
Examples of System Calls:

File Operations: open(), read(), write(), close().
Process Control: fork(), exec(), exit().
Memory Management: mmap(), brk().
Network Operations: socket(), connect(), send(), recv().
How It Works:

The program issues a system call, typically using a library (e.g., the C library glibc).
The library translates the function call into a system call number and triggers a software interrupt or special CPU instruction (e.g., int 0x80 on x86 or syscall).
Control is handed over to the kernel, which performs the requested operation and returns the result to the program.
Performance:

System calls are slower than regular function calls due to the overhead of switching between user mode and kernel mode.
Analogy:
Think of a system call as a customer (user-space program) asking a bank teller (the kernel) to perform an operation. The teller acts as the intermediary who has the authority to access the vault (hardware or system resources).

why system calls matters

because accessing the hardware safely.
