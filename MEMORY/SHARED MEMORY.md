Main function of shared memory is:

****The main function of shared memory is to allow multiple processes to access and share the same memory space to exchange data efficiently.
Instead of copying data between processes****
shared memory provides a mechanism where processes can read and write to a common memory segment. **This reduces overhead and speeds up inter-process communication (IPC).**

Key points:
Fast data exchange: <code style =" color:greenyellow"> Shared memory is one of the fastest forms of IPC because processes can directly access the shared memory segment </code>
Efficient: It eliminates the need to pass data between processes by copying it.
Coordination: Processes often need synchronization mechanisms (like semaphores) to manage access to shared memory and prevent conflicts.

Efficient Data Sharing:

Shared memory allows multiple processes to share data without the need for copying data between processes. This reduces the overhead associated with data transfer and improves performance.
Inter-Process Communication (IPC):

$\color{red}{\textsf{ Shared memory is one of the fastest methods for IPC. It enables processes to communicate by reading from and writing to the same memory space, which is much faster than other IPC mechanisms like pipes, message queues, or sockets.}}$
Synchronization:

textShared memory often requires synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores, mutexes, or condition variables, to ensure that processes do not interfere with each other when accessing shared data. These mechanisms help manage concurrent access to shared memory. 
Reduced Latency:

Since data is directly accessed in memory, shared memory reduces the latency associated with data transfer compared to other IPC methods that involve copying data between processes.
Memory Mapping:

Shared memory can be implemented using memory-mapped files, where a file is mapped into the address space of multiple processes. This allows the processes to share the contents of the file as if it were in memory.
