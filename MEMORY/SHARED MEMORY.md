Main function of shared memory is:

****The main function of shared memory is to allow multiple processes to access and share the same memory space to exchange data efficiently.
Instead of copying data between processes****
shared memory provides a mechanism where processes can read and write to a common memory segment. **This reduces overhead and speeds up inter-process communication (IPC).**

Key points:
Fast data exchange: <font color="green"> Shared memory is one of the fastest forms of IPC because processes can directly access the shared memory segment </font>
Efficient: It eliminates the need to pass data between processes by copying it.
Coordination: Processes often need synchronization mechanisms (like semaphores) to manage access to shared memory and prevent conflicts.
