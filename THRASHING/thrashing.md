### **🔹 Thrashing in Operating Systems**  

#### **🔸 What is Thrashing?**  
🔹 **Thrashing** occurs when a computer spends more time **swapping pages in and out of memory** than executing actual processes.  
🔹 This happens when there is excessive **paging** due to **insufficient RAM** or **poor memory management**.  

---

### **🔸 Causes of Thrashing**  
✅ **High Multiprogramming Level:** Too many processes competing for memory.  
✅ **Insufficient RAM:** Not enough physical memory, leading to frequent swapping.  
✅ **Poor Page Replacement Policy:** If the OS replaces frequently used pages, processes have to reload them often.  
✅ **High Page Fault Rate:** Too many page faults slow down execution.  
✅ **Too Many Active Processes:** The system cannot allocate enough memory to each process.  

---

### **🔸 Effects of Thrashing**  
❌ CPU utilization **drops significantly**.  
❌ System **becomes unresponsive**.  
❌ **High disk I/O** due to excessive page swapping.  
❌ **Slower process execution** instead of improvement.  

---

### **🔸 How to Prevent Thrashing?**  
✅ **Adjust Degree of Multiprogramming:** Reduce the number of processes running at once.  
✅ **Working Set Model:** Keep only frequently used pages in memory.  
✅ **Page Fault Frequency (PFF) Algorithm:** Adjust the number of pages per process dynamically.  
✅ **Increase RAM:** More physical memory reduces swapping.  
✅ **Use Better Page Replacement Policies:** Algorithms like **LRU (Least Recently Used)** and **Working Set Model** help manage memory efficiently.  

---

### **🔸 Real-World Example**  
📌 **Virtual Machines (VMs) on Low RAM Systems**  
- Running multiple VMs on a **low-memory** system can cause thrashing because each VM demands memory, leading to excessive swapping.  

📌 **Old Laptops Running Too Many Applications**  
- If a laptop with **4GB RAM** runs **Chrome with 50 tabs, Photoshop, and a game**, it may start thrashing due to excessive paging.

### **🔸 Interview Questions & Answers**  

#### **1️⃣ What is thrashing in an OS?**  
✅ **Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time paging than executing processes, leading to extreme performance degradation.**  

#### **2️⃣ How does thrashing affect system performance?**  
✅ Thrashing reduces **CPU efficiency**, increases **I/O operations**, and makes the system **unresponsive**.  

#### **3️⃣ What is the main reason for thrashing?**  
✅ **Insufficient memory** and **excessive multiprogramming** cause thrashing by leading to frequent page faults.  

#### **4️⃣ How can an OS detect thrashing?**  
✅ The OS monitors the **page fault rate**—if it is **too high with low CPU usage**, thrashing is occurring.  

#### **5️⃣ What techniques can prevent thrashing?**  
✅ **Working Set Model, Page Fault Frequency Control, Limiting Multiprogramming, and Better Page Replacement Algorithms** help prevent thrashing.

### **🔹 Parallelism vs. Concurrency**  

Both **parallelism** and **concurrency** involve multiple tasks executing simultaneously, but they have different meanings and applications.

---

## **🔸 Concurrency**
**Definition:**  
🔹 Concurrency means handling multiple tasks in progress at the same time. However, they may not necessarily execute at the exact same instant. Instead, they can share resources by switching execution.

**Example:**  
🔹 A single-core CPU using **multithreading** to switch between tasks (like downloading a file while browsing a website).  

**Key Points:**  
✅ Task switching happens quickly, making it seem like tasks run simultaneously.  
✅ Typically used in **multithreading, async programming, and I/O-bound tasks**.  
✅ Example scenario: A restaurant where a chef prepares multiple dishes but works on one at a time.  

---

## **🔸 Parallelism**
**Definition:**  
🔹 Parallelism refers to running multiple tasks **at the exact same time**, usually on multi-core or multi-processor systems.

**Example:**  
🔹 A **quad-core CPU** running four different tasks at the same time (like rendering a 3D model while processing a video).  

**Key Points:**  
✅ Requires multiple CPU cores or processors.  
✅ Best suited for **CPU-intensive tasks** like image processing or scientific computations.  
✅ Example scenario: Multiple chefs in a restaurant cooking different dishes simultaneously.  

---

## **🔸 Concurrency vs. Parallelism – Key Differences**
| Feature        | Concurrency  | Parallelism  |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Execution     | Overlapping but not simultaneous | Truly simultaneous execution |
| Hardware      | Works on any CPU | Requires multiple cores or processors |
| Task Switching | Yes, via threads | No switching, tasks run independently |
| Best For      | I/O-bound tasks, async processing | CPU-bound tasks, heavy computations |
| Example      | Web server handling multiple requests | GPU processing multiple video frames |

---

## **🔸 When to Use What?**
✅ **Use Concurrency** when dealing with multiple tasks that involve waiting (e.g., networking, database queries).  
✅ **Use Parallelism** for compute-heavy tasks where full CPU power is needed.  

---

## **🔸 Real-World Example: Web Server**
🔹 **Concurrent Web Server**: Handles multiple client requests at once using **threads** but serves them one at a time.  
🔹 **Parallel Web Server**: Uses **multiple CPU cores** to serve multiple clients at the same time.

### **🔹 Interview Answers: Concurrency vs. Parallelism**  

#### **1️⃣ What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?**  
✅ **Concurrency** means multiple tasks are in progress at the same time but may not be executing simultaneously (e.g., task switching on a single core).  
✅ **Parallelism** means multiple tasks execute **exactly at the same time** on multiple cores or processors.  

📌 **Example:**  
- **Concurrency**: A single-core CPU running multiple threads (like handling multiple web requests).  
- **Parallelism**: A multi-core CPU running different computations simultaneously (like video rendering).  

---

#### **2️⃣ Can concurrency exist without parallelism? Explain.**  
✅ Yes, **concurrency can exist without parallelism**.  
✅ A single-core system can handle multiple tasks concurrently by switching between them (task switching), but only one task executes at a time.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A **Python program using async functions** can handle multiple network requests concurrently but executes them one by one.  

---

#### **3️⃣ How does an operating system manage concurrency?**  
✅ The OS uses **process scheduling** and **thread management** techniques:  
- **Time-sharing (Preemption)** – The CPU quickly switches between tasks.  
- **Multi-threading** – Threads share the same memory space and execute concurrently.  
- **Asynchronous I/O** – The OS handles I/O-bound tasks efficiently.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A web server like **NGINX** handles thousands of concurrent connections using **asynchronous event loops**.  

---

#### **4️⃣ What are some real-world examples of parallelism?**  
✅ **Multi-core processors:** Running AI models using **parallel computation on GPUs**.  
✅ **Video processing:** A video editor rendering frames **simultaneously** using multiple CPU cores.  
✅ **Scientific simulations:** Weather prediction models running on **supercomputers with thousands of parallel processes**.  

---

#### **5️⃣ Which is better for improving performance: concurrency or parallelism?**  
✅ **It depends on the workload:**  
- **Concurrency is better** for tasks that involve waiting (I/O-bound tasks like network communication).  
- **Parallelism is better** for computationally heavy tasks (CPU-bound tasks like data processing).  

📌 **Example:**  
- **Concurrency:** Web scraping with async requests.  
- **Parallelism:** Matrix multiplication using **OpenMP** in C++.
